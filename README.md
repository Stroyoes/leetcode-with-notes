# `leetcode-with-notes`
A structured collection of LeetCode prep notes and code breakdowns. Focuses on building strong DSA fundamentals with clear explanations, dry runs, edge cases, and step-by-step problem-solving patterns.

> I’m following the [NeetCode Roadmap 🚀](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) to systematically cover core data structures and algorithms. 

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
> This repository is still under development as I am actively learning and documenting. Expect regular updates, refactoring, and improvements. Feel free to suggest enhancements! 🤗
